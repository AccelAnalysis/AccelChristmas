AccelMail is typically a service provider/processor for Recipient Data that our business customers upload (names, addresses, segmentation tags, etc.).

If you connect third-party services (e.g., spreadsheets/CRM/calendar), we may receive metadata and content necessary to perform the integration, based on your settings and permissions.

We may share information with:

Printing/mailing partners (if applicable) to produce and mail campaign materials.
Legal/compliance: to comply with law, subpoenas, or valid government requests.
Business transfers: in connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets.
With your direction: when you enable integrations or instruct us to share.
We do not sell personal information
We do not sell personal information in exchange for money. If laws define “sale” or “share” broadly (e.g., certain targeted advertising contexts), we structure our disclosures as service-provider processing, and we offer choices where applicable.
7) Cookies and Tracking Choices
We use cookies for:
Authentication and session management
Preferences and feature enablement
Security and fraud prevention
Analytics and performance
You can control cookies through browser settings. Some features may not function properly if cookies are disabled.

We retain information for as long as necessary to:
Provide the Services and your Account
Maintain records for legitimate business purposes (audit trails, dispute resolution)
Comply with legal obligations
You may request deletion subject to contractual, operational, and legal limits (see Section 11).
9) Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information (e.g., access controls, encryption in transit, least-privilege). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
10) Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under 13 (and not intended for minors). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child provided information, contact us to remove it.
