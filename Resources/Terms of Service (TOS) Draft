These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the AccelMail platform and related services (the “Services”), operated by Accel Analysis, LLC (doing business as “AccelMail”) (“AccelMail,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Services, you agree to these Terms.
If you are using the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent you have authority to bind that entity, and “you” refers to that entity.

Recipient Data: Contact and address data or other information about prospects/recipients that you upload or provide to fulfill a Campaign.
Order: A request to print, prepare, or mail materials, or purchase subscription/credits/add-ons.
QR Tracking: Collection of event data when a QR code is scanned or visited (e.g., timestamp, approximate location, device/browser data).

4) Account Registration and Security
You agree to provide accurate information and keep it updated. You are responsible for:

All activities that occur under your Account
Not sharing access except as allowed by your plan or written permission from us
Notify us immediately of any suspected unauthorized access.
5) Your Responsibilities (Compliance + Data Rights)
You are responsible for:
Lawful marketing use. Ensuring your Campaigns comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including advertising, consumer protection, privacy, and any industry rules).
Recipient Data authority. You represent and warrant you have the legal right to collect, use, upload, and share Recipient Data for the Campaign(s) you run.
Truthful content. Ensuring claims, offers, pricing, and disclosures are accurate and not misleading.
Suppression lists / opt-outs (if applicable). If you use email/SMS features (if offered), you agree to comply with CAN-SPAM, TCPA, and similar laws.
6) Prohibited Uses

Violate laws or third-party rights
Send or promote deceptive, fraudulent, or misleading content

Infringe IP rights (copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights)

7) Content Ownership and License
You own your Content (including creative and Recipient Data), as between you and us.
You grant AccelMail a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, transmit, display, and use your Content only to provide, maintain, and improve the Services, including fulfilling Orders and providing analytics.
8) Recipient Data and List Quality
You acknowledge that list quality significantly affects results and deliverability. We may:
Flag obvious formatting issues
Require minimum data standards for mailing
Reject lists that appear unlawful, purchased from prohibited sources, or likely to cause harm or high complaint rates
9) Orders, Printing, and Mailing
If the Services include printing/mailing coordination:
Production proofs. You are responsible for reviewing proofs/approvals (when provided). Once approved, changes may be treated as a new Order.
Addressing and postage. Mailing processes may depend on USPS requirements and third-party workflows.
Delivery windows. Delivery timing is an estimate only; USPS and third-party processes are outside our control.
Returned/undeliverable. You may receive undeliverable/returned quantities; these do not automatically qualify for refunds.
10) Pricing, Taxes, and Payment
You agree to pay all fees shown at checkout or in an Order form, including:
Subscription fees, usage fees, credits, add-ons
Printing and postage costs (if applicable)
Applicable taxes
We may use third-party payment processors. You authorize us (and our processors) to charge your payment method.
11) Subscription Auto-Renewal and Cancellation
Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled before the renewal date.
Cancellation stops future renewals; it does not retroactively refund already-paid periods unless required by law or explicitly stated in your plan.
If your payment fails, we may retry charges and/or downgrade, pause, or suspend features until payment is resolved.
12) Refund Policy (Template — Customize Carefully)
Unless otherwise stated in writing:
Digital/subscription fees: Non-refundable once the billing period begins (except where required by law).
Printing and postage: Non-refundable once production or mailing has started.
Errors caused by us: If we confirm a material error solely caused by us (e.g., wrong QR destination generated by our system), we may, at our option, reprint/re-mail, issue credits, or provide a partial refund.
Chargebacks: If you initiate a chargeback without first contacting support to resolve the issue, we may suspend your Account.
13) Free Trials / Beta Features
Trials and beta features may be offered “as is” and may be modified or discontinued at any time. Trial eligibility may be limited.
14) Third-Party Services and Links
The Services may interoperate with third-party products (USPS tools, printers, CRMs, analytics, mapping tools, etc.). We are not responsible for third-party services, and your use of them is governed by their terms.
15) Intellectual Property
We own the Services, including software, designs, interfaces, templates (unless marked as user-owned), and all related IP. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, or create derivative works of the Services except as permitted.
16) Feedback
If you provide suggestions or feedback, you grant us the right to use it without restriction or compensation.
17) Confidentiality (Optional)
If you receive non-public information about our Services, pricing, roadmap, or operations, you agree to keep it confidential and use it only to evaluate or use the Services.
18) Disclaimers
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
We do not warrant that:
Campaigns will achieve any particular outcome
QR tracking will capture every scan (device/network/browser variability exists)
The Services will be uninterrupted or error-free
19) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:
ACCELMAIL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF:
(A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US IN THE 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR
(B) $500.
(Adjust these numbers to match your risk tolerance.)
Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some may not apply to you.
20) Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless AccelMail from claims arising out of:
Your Content, Recipient Data, Campaigns, or offers
Your violation of law or third-party rights
Your misuse of the Services
21) Suspension and Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if:
You breach these Terms
Your use creates risk or legal exposure
Payment is delinquent
Required by law
You may stop using the Services at any time. Certain sections survive termination (e.g., fees owed, IP, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification).
22) Dispute Resolution (Pick One Approach)
Option A: Arbitration Clause (Common in SaaS)
Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, with limited exceptions (e.g., small claims, IP injunction).
Option B: Court Jurisdiction Only
Disputes will be resolved in state/federal courts located in [Your County/City, State].
(You should have an attorney finalize this section; it can materially change your risk.)
23) Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules.
24) Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted with an updated “Last Updated” date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
